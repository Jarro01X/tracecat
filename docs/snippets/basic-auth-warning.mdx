<Warning>
  The default Docker compose configuration has basic email / password auth enabled.
  Basic auth is **not recommended** for production environments, especially if exposed to the public internet.

  Please consider using a more secure authentication method such as [OAuth](/self-hosting/authentication/google-oauth) or [SAML SSO](/self-hosting/authentication/saml-sso)
  unless running in an air-gapped environment with defense-in-depth controls.
</Warning>
